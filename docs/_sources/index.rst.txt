multi-subject source localization with MNE
==========================================

*version 0.0.1*

Description:
------------

This small package helps perform EEG and MEG source localization jointly on many
subjects. The inverse problems of all subjects are solved congruently using a
binding regularization.


Installation
------------

On a working `mne-python <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_ environment:

::

  git clone https://github.com/hichamjanati/groupmne
  cd groupmne
  python setup.py develop

Otherwise, we recommend creating this minimal `conda env <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hichamjanati/groupmne/master/environment.yml>`_

::

  conda env create --file environment.yml
  conda activate groupmne-env
  git clone https://github.com/hichamjanati/groupmne
  cd groupmne
  python setup.py develop


Examples
-------------

For examples, see `the tutorials <auto_examples/index>`_.
